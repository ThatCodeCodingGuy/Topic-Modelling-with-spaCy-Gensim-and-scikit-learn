# Topic-Modeling-with-spaCy-Gensim-and-scikit-learn
This project uses spaCy, Gensim and scikit-learn for topic modeling on the NeurIPS (NIPS) Papers dataset.

In this project, I make a NLP pipeline consisting of spaCy, Gensim and scikit-learn. I use spaCy for text preprocessing, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model algorithm of both Gensim and scikit-learn. Additionally, to gain insight about the results, I use pyLDAvis for topic model visualization.
I decided to use random 1000 sample of NeuroIPS papers from year-year in this project.

## What have I learned?:

During the preparation of the NLP pipeline, I realized how important the data preprocessing is. Therefore, the lesson I drew is that in real life data, we are most likely to spend our time on the preprocessing, rather than
on trying different algorithms.
